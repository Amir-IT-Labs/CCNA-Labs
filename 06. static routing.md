# 🛰️ Static Routing Lab – 3 Routers, 2 Switches, and 2 PCs

This lab demonstrates how static routing works in a multi-router environment using three routers, two switches, and two PCs across different networks. The goal is to enable full connectivity between all devices using static routes only.


🧱 Topology Overview

🔗 Device Connections:

- PC1 (192.168.1.1) → Switch1 → Router1 (`G0/0`)
- Router1 (`G0/1`) ↔ Router2 (`G0/0`)
- Router2 (`G0/1`) ↔ Router3 (`G0/1`)
- Router3 (`G0/2`) → Switch2 → PC2 (192.168.14.1)


🌐 IP Addressing Scheme

| Device Interface      | IP Address        | Description         |
|------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| PC1                   | 192.168.1.1       | End device 1        |
| Router1 `G0/0`         | 192.168.1.254     | To Switch1/PC1      |
| Router1 `G0/1`         | 192.168.12.1      | To Router2          |
| Router2 `G0/0`         | 192.168.12.2      | To Router1          |
| Router2 `G0/1`         | 192.168.13.2      | To Router3          |
| Router3 `G0/1`         | 192.168.13.3      | To Router2          |
| Router3 `G0/2`         | 192.168.14.254    | To Switch2/PC2      |
| PC2                   | 192.168.14.1      | End device 2        |

 📡 Static Routes Configuration

✅ Router 1:

ip route 192.168.13.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.2
ip route 192.168.14.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.2

✅ Router 2:

ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.1
ip route 192.168.14.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.3

✅ Router 3:

ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.2
ip route 192.168.12.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.2


🎯 Objective
Establish end-to-end communication between PC1 (192.168.1.1) and PC2 (192.168.14.1)

Practice static routing using next-hop IP addresses

Understand packet flow in both LAN and WAN segments

🔄 How Data Flows
▶️ PC1 → PC2:
PC1 sees PC2 is in another subnet → forwards packet to Router1 (192.168.1.254)

Router1 forwards packet to Router2 → then to Router3

Router3 routes the packet to PC2 via Switch2

◀️ PC2 → PC1:
PC2 forwards the return packet to Router3

Router3 → Router2 → Router1 → delivers to PC1

All routers forward packets based on their static routing tables.

🛠️ Tools Used
Cisco Packet Tracer (simulation platform)

Basic static routing commands

IPv4 addressing and subnetting
