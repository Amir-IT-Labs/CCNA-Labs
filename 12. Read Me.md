# 🔧 Small Office VLAN Lab – Physical Interface-Based Inter-VLAN Routing 🔧

This lab demonstrates how to design a VLAN-based network using **3 physical interfaces** on a router for inter-VLAN routing. This method connects each VLAN to a separate router port, forming an efficient layout for small environments.

## 🧩 Network Design Overview

- 🏢 **Departments**: 3  
- 🎯 **VLANs**: 3 (Management, Finance, Marketing)  
- 🌐 **IP Subnetting**: Used **VLSM** for efficient IP address allocation  
- 🔌 **Router Interfaces**: 3 physical links from router to switch (G0/0, G0/1, G0/2)  
- 📶 **Switch Ports**: Each PC connected to access ports associated with a VLAN

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- ✔️ This setup is ideal for small labs or limited setups.
- ⚠️ Not scalable due to **limited physical ports** on routers.
- 🔒 VLANs isolate broadcast traffic and enhance **performance and security**.
- 📐 VLSM ensures **efficient use of IP addresses**.
- 🔐 Security policies on routers/firewalls apply **only between VLANs**.
- ⚠️ Devices within the same VLAN **bypass router/firewall policies** when communicating.
