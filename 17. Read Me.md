# 🌐 RSTP (Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol) - Redundant Switching Lab

## 📘 Lab Overview
This lab demonstrates the configuration and behavior of **Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)** (IEEE 802.1w) in a redundant Layer 2 switching environment. The goal is to ensure network redundancy and fast convergence during link failures.

---

## 🧪 Lab Topology
- **4 Cisco Switches**: SW1, SW2, SW3, SW4
- **6 PCs** connected across multiple switches
- Redundant links between switches
- Each switch participates in RSTP
- Access ports configured with **PortFast**

## ⚙️ Configuration Highlights
- Enabled **RSTP** using `spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst`
- Set switch priorities to influence root bridge election
- Used `show spanning-tree` to verify port roles and root bridge status
- Enabled **PortFast** on all access ports connected to end devices:
  ```
  interface range fa0/1 - 2
    spanning-tree portfast
  ```

---

## 🔍 Observed Behavior
- Fast convergence (<6 seconds) on link failures
- Root Bridge elected based on lowest priority (or MAC address if priorities match)
- Port roles: Root Port, Designated Port, Alternate Port (instead of Blocking)
- **Discarding** state replaces Listening/Learning in traditional STP

---

## 💡 Key Concepts
- RSTP is much faster than STP (802.1D)
- **PortFast** is used to skip the usual STP states on access ports
- Alternate ports help avoid loops while allowing quick recovery

---

## 🛠️ Useful Commands
```bash
show spanning-tree
spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst
spanning-tree vlan <vlan-id> priority <value>
spanning-tree portfast
```
