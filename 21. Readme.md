# EIGRP Lab – 4 Routers with Loopbacks

## **Lab Overview**
This lab demonstrates the configuration of EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) on a network of four routers connected in a square topology.  
Each router also has a Loopback interface to simulate different networks. EIGRP is configured to advertise these networks and share routing information.

## **EIGRP Explanation**
- **AS Number (Autonomous System Number):** All routers in EIGRP must have the same AS number to form neighbor relationships.
- **`no auto-summary`:** Prevents EIGRP from automatically summarizing routes at classful boundaries.
- **Passive Interface:** Stops sending EIGRP Hello packets on specified interfaces but still advertises the connected network.
- **Network Command:** Specifies which networks EIGRP will advertise and attempt to form adjacencies on.
- **Loopbacks:** Useful for testing reachability and simulating real-world networks.
- **`do show ip eigrp neighbors`:** Displays EIGRP neighbor relationships.
- **`do show ip route eigrp`:** Displays routes learned via EIGRP.

## **How the Network Works**
1. **EIGRP Neighbor Formation:** Routers exchange Hello packets on active interfaces.  
2. **Route Advertisement:** Each router advertises connected networks to its neighbors.  
3. **PC Connectivity:** PC1 in 192.168.4.0/24 should be able to reach all loopback networks and other routers.  
4. **Passive Interfaces:** Loopbacks and non-adjacent interfaces are set to passive to reduce unnecessary EIGRP traffic.

## **Verification**
- Ping between all routers' loopbacks.
- Check `show ip route` to ensure EIGRP-learned routes are present.
- Verify neighbor relationships with `show ip eigrp neighbors`.
