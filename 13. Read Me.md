# 🧪 CCNA Lab: VLANs, VLSM, Inter-VLAN Routing (SVIs) & NAT with Internet Access

This lab demonstrates the configuration of VLANs using VLSM, Inter-VLAN routing via a Multilayer Switch, trunking between access switches, NAT for internet access, and default/static routing for full end-to-end connectivity.

---

## 📌 Lab Features
- ✅ VLANs with VLSM
- ✅ Inter-VLAN Routing via **SVIs on Multilayer Switch**
- ✅ NAT (PAT) for Internet access
- ✅ Static Routing (R1 ↔ Internet)
- ✅ Default Route (MLS ↔ R1)
- ✅ Trunking between switches
- ✅ PC Connectivity across VLANs and to the Internet

## 🔧 Configuration Steps

### 🔁 Trunk Ports on Access Switches
```bash
interface Gig0/1
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30,40
```

### 🔧 Multilayer Switch (MLS1) – SVIs and Routing
```bash
conf t
ip routing

interface Vlan10
 ip address 192.168.1.126 255.255.255.128
interface Vlan20
 ip address 192.168.1.190 255.255.255.192
interface Vlan30
 ip address 192.168.1.222 255.255.255.224
interface Vlan40
 ip address 192.168.1.238 255.255.255.240

interface Gig1/0/1
 description #connected to R1#
 ip address 192.168.1.249 255.255.255.252
 no shutdown

ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.250
```

---

### 📡 Router 1 (R1) Configuration – NAT, Routing, Interfaces
```bash
conf t
hostname R1

interface Gig0/0
 description #Connected to MLS1#
 ip address 192.168.1.250 255.255.255.252
 ip nat inside
 no shutdown

interface Serial0/1/0
 description #Connected to INTERNET#
 ip address 1.1.1.249 255.255.255.252
 ip nat outside
 no shutdown

ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 1.1.1.250

! NAT Configuration
access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.127
access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.128 0.0.0.63
access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.192 0.0.0.31
access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.224 0.0.0.15
access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.248 0.0.0.3

ip nat inside source list 1 interface Serial0/1/0 overload
```

### 🌐 Router 2 (Internet Simulation)
```bash
interface Serial0/3/0
 ip address 1.1.1.250 255.255.255.252
 no shutdown
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Performed
- VLAN 40 was unreachable due to missing VLAN on trunk → fixed by adding it to `allowed vlan`
- Hosts couldn’t ping R1 → fixed NAT ACL to include all VLSM ranges
- Verified trunk and SVI setup using:
```bash
do show vlan
show interface trunk
```

## 🖼️ Screenshots
- 📸 Network topology (uploaded)
- 📸 ping outputs from PC → R1 → Internet
- 📸 `show ip route` and NAT translations on R1

---

## ✅ Outcome
- All VLANs successfully configured and communicating
- PCs across VLANs can reach Internet
- NAT working through R1 to R2
- VLSM planning successfully optimized IP usage
- Full connectivity achieved from PC1 → Cloud (Internet)
