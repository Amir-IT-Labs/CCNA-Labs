🔧 CCNA Lab – VLSM Subnetting & Static Routing Lab
📘 Lab Overview
This lab demonstrates the use of VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) along with Static Routing via Next-Hop. The topology consists of two routers, four LANs, multiple switches, and end devices (PCs) spread across different subnet sizes according to host requirements. Static routing is configured to enable communication between all networks.

🖥️ Network Topology
Router 1 (R1) connects LAN1 and LAN2

Router 2 (R2) connects LAN3 and LAN4

R1 and R2 are connected via a point-to-point /30 link

Each LAN is connected through switches

All unused switch ports are administratively shut down with a description

All active switch ports are labeled using description commands to indicate device connections

🧩 Subnet Design
We used the base network 192.168.10.0/24 and broke it down using VLSM to match different host requirements.

🔢 LAN Host Requirements:

| LAN          | PCs Needed | Subnet Used |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| LAN 1        | 120 PCs    | `/25`       |
| LAN 2        | 58 PCs     | `/26`       |
| LAN 3        | 30 PCs     | `/27`       |
| LAN 4        | 13 PCs     | `/28`       |
| R1 ↔ R2 Link | 2 Hosts    | `/30`       |

⚙️ Router Configurations
🔁 Static Routing (via Next-Hop)
Static routes were configured using next-hop IP addresses.

📍 On Router 1 (R1):

ip route 192.168.10.192 255.255.255.224 192.168.10.242  ! LAN3
ip route 192.168.10.224 255.255.255.240 192.168.10.242  ! LAN4

📍 On Router 2 (R2):

ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.128 192.168.10.241    ! LAN1
ip route 192.168.10.128 255.255.255.192 192.168.10.241  ! LAN2


🐞 Troubleshooting
Initially, PC1 couldn’t ping PC3 or PC4. After verifying IPs, subnet masks, default gateways, and cable connections, we checked the static routes and discovered the issue.

❌ Incorrect Static Routes (On Both Routers)
At first, we mistakenly configured the routes like this:

🔴 On Router 1:

ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.224 192.168.10.242
ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.240 192.168.10.242


🔴 On Router 2:

ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.128 192.168.10.241
ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.192 192.168.10.241

These routes were incorrect because they used overlapping networks instead of the actual network IDs for /27 and /28. As a result, packets were being dropped at Router 1.

✅ Fixed Static Routes
We corrected the configurations by specifying the exact network IDs:

✅ Router 1 (corrected):

ip route 192.168.10.192 255.255.255.224 192.168.10.242
ip route 192.168.10.224 255.255.255.240 192.168.10.242


✅ Router 2 (corrected):

ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.128 192.168.10.241
ip route 192.168.10.128 255.255.255.192 192.168.10.241

🎯 Lesson Learned
In static routing, always use the actual network ID of the destination subnet — not a larger or overlapping network.

Using overlapping networks like 192.168.10.0 for multiple subnets can confuse the router and cause dropped packets.

🔒 Switch Configuration Practices
All unused switch ports were shut down using shutdown

Descriptions were added to all ports:

Active ports: description Connected to PCx or Connected to Router

Inactive ports: description Not in Use

This helps improve network documentation, security, and clarity during troubleshooting.

✅ Final Result
After correcting the routes:

All PCs can successfully ping each other

Routing is working between all four LANs

The network is functioning as expected using VLSM + Static Routing
