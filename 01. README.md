Basic Network Topology for Understanding Nodes and Connections

This is a basic network topology created in Cisco Packet Tracer. The purpose of this lab is to understand how different networking devices (nodes) are connected and what roles they play. No configuration is done in this lab â€” it is only for understanding the structure.

Lab Overview:

There are two branches:

Branch A (Left Side):
- Firewall
- Router
- Switch
- 2 PCs (end hosts)

Branch B (Right Side):
- Router
- Firewall
- Switch
- 2 Servers

Learning Objectives:
- Understand what network nodes are.
- Learn how routers, switches, firewalls, PCs, and servers are connected.
- Understand the difference between clients and servers.
- Realize that sometimes clients can also act as servers.
- Learn where firewalls can be placed (before or after routers).
- Understand that routers connect different networks, while switches connect multiple end devices.
- Notice that routers usually have fewer Ethernet ports than switches.
