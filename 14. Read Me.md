# 🧠 CCNA Lab: VLANs, VTP Modes (Server, Transparent, Client), and Static Trunking

This lab is designed to demonstrate the configuration and behavior of **VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol)** and **manual trunking** across Cisco Layer 2 switches, without using a router or multilayer switch for inter-VLAN routing.

> ⚠️ This lab does **not include routing**. Inter-VLAN communication is not configured. The focus is strictly on **Layer 2 switching**, **VTP**, **DTP**, and **VLAN propagation**.

---

## 🔧 Lab Objectives

- Understand and configure different **VTP modes**: Server, Transparent, and Client.
- Practice **manual VLAN creation** and propagation using VTP.
- Configure **static trunk links** using `switchport mode trunk` and `switchport nonegotiate`.
- Verify VLAN database synchronization using VTP.
- Confirm **no inter-VLAN routing** is possible without Layer 3 devices.

---

## 🧩 Topology Overview

- **3 Cisco Layer 2 Switches**:
  - `SW1`: VTP Server
  - `SW2`: VTP Transparent
  - `SW3`: VTP Client
- Multiple **PCs** are connected to access ports assigned to specific VLANs.
- **Trunk ports** connect the switches using **manual trunking (no DTP negotiation)**.

## 🗂️ VTP Configuration

| Switch | VTP Mode      | Domain    | VLAN Creation Allowed? | Forwards VLANs? |
|--------|---------------|-----------|-------------------------|------------------|
| SW1    | Server        | `CCNA`    | ✅ Yes                  | ✅ Yes           |
| SW2    | Transparent   | `CCNA`    | ✅ Yes (locally only)   | ✅ Yes           |
| SW3    | Client        | `CCNA`    | ❌ No                   | ✅ Yes (syncs)   |

### 🔧 Example VTP Configuration on Switches

```bash
# On SW1 (VTP Server)
vtp mode server
vtp domain CCNA
vtp version 2

# On SW2 (VTP Transparent)
vtp mode transparent
vtp domain CCNA
vtp version 2

# On SW3 (VTP Client)
vtp mode client
vtp domain CCNA
vtp version 2
```

> All switches must be in the same **VTP domain** to synchronize VLANs.

## 🌐 VLANs Used

| VLAN ID | VLAN Name | Subnet Used       | Hosts (Examples) |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| 10      | HR        | 10.0.0.0/26       | PC1, PC2         |
| 20      | IT        | 10.0.0.64/26      | PC8, PC9         |
| 30      | Sales     | 10.0.0.128/26     | PC6, PC7         |
| 40      | Accounts  | 10.0.0.192/26     | PC3, PC4, PC5    |

> These VLANs were created on the **VTP Server** (SW1) and **automatically appeared** on the client (SW3). Transparent mode (SW2) does not sync but forwards advertisements.

---

## 🔗 Trunking Configuration

Trunks were **manually configured** between switches with **DTP disabled**.

### 🔧 Example Trunk Config:

```bash
interface gig0/1
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport nonegotiate
```

> DTP is disabled to follow **secure, production-like practice**. This also prevents unwanted dynamic negotiation.

---

## ❌ No Inter-VLAN Routing

This lab does **not include any router** or **multilayer switch**, so **inter-VLAN communication is not possible**.

- PCs can **only communicate within the same VLAN**.
- VLANs remain **isolated from each other** (as designed).
- Default gateways configured on PCs **have no effect**, since there's no Layer 3 routing device to forward traffic.

## 🧪 Lab Testing Results

| Test                         | Expected Result | Status  |
|-----------------------------|------------------|---------|
| PC1 ↔ PC2 (VLAN10)          | ✅ Ping success   | ✅ Pass |
| PC8 ↔ PC9 (VLAN20)          | ✅ Ping success   | ✅ Pass |
| PC3 ↔ PC4 ↔ PC5 (VLAN40)    | ✅ Ping success   | ✅ Pass |
| PC1 → PC8 (VLAN10 → VLAN20) | ❌ Ping fails     | ✅ Expected |
| PC6 → PC3 (VLAN30 → VLAN40) | ❌ Ping fails     | ✅ Expected |

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- **VTP Server** pushes VLANs to all client switches within the domain.
- **Transparent mode** doesn’t sync VLANs but does forward VTP advertisements.
- **Manual trunking + no DTP** is a secure and professional way to configure trunk links.
- **Without a Layer 3 device**, VLANs remain **isolated** — no inter-VLAN routing.
- This lab builds strong CCNA-level understanding of VLAN propagation and trunking.

## ✅ Next Steps

- Try replacing one switch with a **multilayer switch** or add a **router-on-a-stick** to enable inter-VLAN routing.
- Observe how VLAN gateways work with `ip routing` or subinterfaces.
- Compare VTP with **manual VLAN configuration** to understand control vs security trade-offs.
