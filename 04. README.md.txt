🛠️ CCNA Lab: IPv4 Addressing | Router Interface Setup | Inter-Network Connectivity

This lab is designed to practice key networking concepts such as IPv4 addressing, router interface configuration, and enabling communication between different networks. The lab was built using Cisco Packet Tracer.

🔍 Network Topology Overview

PC0 → 10.0.0.1

PC1 → 172.16.0.1

PC3 → 192.168.1.1

Switch and Router Connections:

Switch 0 → Router0 G0/0 ➤ Gateway: 10.255.255.254

Switch 1 → Router0 G0/1 ➤ Gateway: 172.16.255.254

Switch 2 → Router0 G0/2 ➤ Gateway: 192.168.1.254

🧑‍💻 Router Configuration Commands Used:
