Ethernet Cabling Basics – CCNA Lab
This lab demonstrates the basics of Ethernet and the correct use of cables to connect different network devices.

🧠 What is Ethernet?
Ethernet is a set of networking standards used in Local Area Networks (LANs). It defines how devices communicate, the type of cables used, and how data is transmitted.

🧵 UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) Cables
Common Ethernet cable made of copper.

Supports full-duplex communication (send and receive at the same time).

Uses RJ45 connectors.

Pin usage:

Pins 1 & 2 – Transmit

Pins 3 & 6 – Receive

Single cable handles both sending and receiving, because it contains multiple twisted pairs inside (each pair used for a different direction).

🔌 Types of Ethernet Cables
1. Straight-Through Cable
Used to connect different devices:

PC to Switch

Router to Switch

Pin configuration: 1→1, 2→2, 3→3, 6→6

2. Crossover Cable
Used to connect similar devices:

Switch to Switch

Router to Router

Pins are crossed:

1↔3, 2↔6

3. Auto-MDI-X
Many modern routers and switches support Auto-MDI-X.

Automatically adjusts pin configuration—no need to worry about cable type.

⚡ UTP Cable Speed and Distance
Supports 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, and 1 Gbps (Gigabit Ethernet).

Gigabit Ethernet uses all 4 wire pairs (pins 1–8).

Maximum cable length: 100 meters

🔭 Fiber Optic Cables Overview
Fiber optics are used for long-distance, high-speed, and EMI-free communication. They transmit data using light signals instead of electrical signals.

🔌 Ports for Fiber
SFP (Small Form-Factor Pluggable) ports are used to connect fiber optic cables.

Found on switches, routers, and network equipment.

SFP modules must match the required fiber type (SMF or MMF).

🔄 Fiber Transmission
Fiber cables use two separate cables (or cores):

One for sending

One for receiving

Unlike UTP, where a single cable carries both directions via different wire pairs, fiber requires two strands to handle bi-directional communication.

🌐 Fiber Types and Differences
1. Single-Mode Fiber (SMF)
Core: Narrow (~9 microns)

Light Source: Laser

Distance: 10–40 km or more

Use Case: Long-distance (WAN, ISP)

Cost: Higher

2. Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF)
Core: Wider (~50–62.5 microns)

Light Source: LED

Distance: 150–600 meters

Use Case: Short/medium distance (data centers, campuses)

Cost: Lower

🔐 Security Note
UTP cables can leak small signals and are affected by electromagnetic interference (EMI).

Fiber optics are immune to EMI and do not leak signals—making them more secure and reliable for data transmission.

🧪 Lab Purpose
This lab in Cisco Packet Tracer shows how to use the correct cable type (UTP or Fiber) between different devices. It helps build a clear understanding of device connections, cable types, and physical layer networking.
