# 🧪 Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) Lab Documentation

## 🖥️ Lab Overview

This lab is designed to demonstrate the working of STP (Spanning Tree Protocol), root bridge selection per VLAN, path cost tuning, and basic STP security features such as PortFast and BPDU Guard.

### 🧭 Topology Summary

- 4 Switches: SW1, SW2, SW3, SW4
- 2 VLANs:
  - **VLAN 1**: Green Zone (172.16.0.0/25)
  - **VLAN 2**: Yellow Zone (172.16.0.128/25)
- 2 End Devices:
  - **PC1** (VLAN 1): Connected to SW3 (F0/3)
  - **PC2** (VLAN 2): Connected to SW4 (F0/3)

## 🧱 STP Configuration

### 🔁 Root Bridge Roles

- **SW1** is manually configured as:
  - 🟢 Root Bridge for **VLAN 1**
  - 🟡 Secondary Bridge for **VLAN 2**

- **SW2** is manually configured as:
  - 🟡 Root Bridge for **VLAN 2**
  - 🟢 Secondary Bridge for **VLAN 1**

This setup demonstrates **per-VLAN spanning-tree** control.

## ⚙️ Path Cost Manipulation

- On **SW4**, the interface **F0/2** was assigned a custom STP cost of `90`.

```bash
interface FastEthernet0/2
 spanning-tree vlan 1 cost 90
```

- Purpose: To verify STP recalculates the path and alters port roles accordingly.
- Outcome: STP successfully recalculated and changed the path, confirming the effect of custom cost settings.

## 🔒 STP Security Features

### ⏩ PortFast Configuration

Enabled on **access ports** connected to PCs (end devices), to skip Listening and Learning states and directly enter Forwarding.

- **SW3 – F0/3** (PC1)
- **SW4 – F0/3** (PC2)

```bash
interface FastEthernet0/3
 spanning-tree portfast
```

### 🛡️ BPDU Guard

Also enabled on access ports to protect the network from rogue switches.

```bash
interface FastEthernet0/3
 spanning-tree bpduguard enable
```

This ensures if a BPDU is received on the port, the port will go into **err-disable** state, preventing loop threats from unauthorized devices.

## ✅ Conclusion

This lab successfully covered:
- Per-VLAN root bridge configuration.
- STP path cost modification and verification.
- PortFast and BPDU Guard on access ports.

### 📁 Additional Notes

Make sure:
- Trunk links are properly configured between switches.
- VLANs are created and assigned appropriately.
- PCs are configured with correct IP addresses from the given subnets.

📌 **Next Steps**:
- Test recovery from link failures.
- Add redundant links and verify convergence time.
- Experiment with **Rapid STP (RSTP)** for faster recovery.
