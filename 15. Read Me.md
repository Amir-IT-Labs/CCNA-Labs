# STP Topology Lab (Spanning Tree Protocol)

This is a lab designed in Cisco Packet Tracer to understand how STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) works in a redundant Layer 2 network. The topology includes four switches: SW1, SW2, SW3, and SW4.



## 🧠 Lab Objective

To understand:
- How the STP elects the Root Bridge.
- How different port roles (Root, Designated, Alternate) are assigned.
- What happens in redundant paths.
- How switches block certain ports to prevent loops.

## 🔧 Switch Priority and MAC Addresses

| Switch | Priority | MAC Address       | Role         |
|--------|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| SW1    | 32769    | 0001.4338.79D8    | Non-root     |
| SW2    | 28673    | 0002.16D6.D0B8    | Non-root     |
| SW3    | 24577    | 00E0.F9E6.44A5    | **Root**     |
| SW4    | 32769    | 0090.0C01.9587    | Non-root     |

> 📌 SW3 has the **lowest priority** and therefore becomes the **Root Bridge**.

## 🔎 Port Roles and STP Behavior

### 📍 SW3 (Root Bridge)

All ports are Designated and in Forwarding State.

**Command Output:**

```
SW3#show spanning-tree vlan 1
This bridge is the root
Fa0/1  - Desg FWD
Fa0/2  - Desg FWD
Fa0/3  - Desg FWD
Gi0/1  - Desg FWD
```

---

### 📍 SW1

- Fa0/4 is the Root Port (cost 19).
- Fa0/1, Fa0/2, Fa0/3 are Alternate ports (Blocked).

```
SW1#show spanning-tree
Fa0/4  - Root FWD
Fa0/1  - Altn BLK
Fa0/2  - Altn BLK
Fa0/3  - Altn BLK
```

---

### 📍 SW2

- Gi0/1 is the Root Port (cost 4).
- Fa0/1 and Fa0/2 are Designated Ports (FWD).
- Fa0/3 is Alternate (Blocked).

```
SW2#show spanning-tree
Gi0/1  - Root FWD
Fa0/1  - Desg FWD
Fa0/2  - Desg FWD
Fa0/3  - Altn BLK
```

---

### 📍 SW4

- Gi0/2 is the Root Port (cost 4).
- Gi0/1 is Designated (FWD).

```
SW4#show spanning-tree
Gi0/2 - Root FWD
Gi0/1 - Desg FWD
```

---

## 🔄 STP Details (Timers)

- **Hello Time**: 2 seconds
- **Max Age**: 20 seconds
- **Forward Delay**: 15 seconds

---

## ✅ Summary

- STP elected **SW3** as the Root Bridge.
- Alternate ports are placed in blocking state to prevent loops.
- STP converges and brings only best paths to the forwarding state.
- Cost is lower over Gigabit links (4) vs FastEthernet (19).
